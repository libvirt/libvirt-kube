Source repository
-----------------

The master source repository for the project is hosted on libvirt.org

   http://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt-kube.git
   git://libvirt.org/libvirt-kube.git

For the purposes of Go build, the package is considered to be in
the namespace "libvirt.org/libvirt-kube"

Building
--------

The project uses Go vendoring, but the 3rd party deps are not checked
into git. Use of the "glide" tool is required to import the 3rd party
deps prior to build

  $ go get github.com/Masterminds/glide

A Makefile is provided to simpify the proces of fetching deps and
building commands

  $ make

The generated binaries will get created in the dir build/
