 Libvirt Kube Architecture
 -------------------------

The goal of this architecture design is to enable integration of
libvirt with kubernetes, so that VMs can be launched and managed
in Kubernetes with no additional complexity vs containers. To
achieve this there are a few central requirements

 - MUST not require a custom Kubelet install on the host.
 
   ie the launch process has to be able to use Docker, even
   if it is just a shim that gets escaped from

 - MUST allow for a custom Kubelet install on the host

   ie the launch process should be able to use a custom
   kubelet CRI to directly launch VMs, bypassing any
   need to use Docker

 - The "container" MUST be the fundamental object that
   causes creation of the VMs.

   ie the user must be able to use "kubectl create" with
   a container object kind. They must not be forced to
   use a different object kind that creates the container
   on their behalf. This is to ensure that they can still
   use all the regular Kubernetes facilities for managing
   containers - Deployment, CronJob, Pet Sets, Replication
   Sets, etc must all be capable of launching VMs in the
   normal manner

 - The VM configuration MUST be part of the container image

   ie the various facilities like Deployment, CronJob,
   Pet Sets, etc must see the container image as the entire
   thing to be launched

 - The schedular MUST be able to do placement via VM info

   ie libvirt specific host knowledge must be made available
   to the scheduler so that it can refine placement decisions
   made by the core kubernetes scheduler logic. eg restrict
   host to those that provide a certain PCI device, or have
   specific host CPU flags, or a specific QEMU machine type
   available, etc

 - All normal VM operations MUST be managed via Kube API

   ie once the VM is running, other VM specific operations
   have to be invoked via the Kube API in some manner.
   This is to ensure that users don't need to use one set
   of APIs for launch, and a different set of APIs for
   post-launch mgmt.


Components
----------

Bearing in mind the requirements above, the following
components will be required

 - virtkubevmshim

   A shim distributed in the docker image, that is the
   init process for the container. It reads the config
   file from the image, and constructs the corresponding
   XML for a specific instance. It connects to libvirtd
   and spawns the VM. It uses AUTODESTROY flag to ensure
   that libvirt kills the VM when the container is stopped.

   This is used when running against a Kubernetes install
   that uses Docker (or an other similar impl) as the CRI

 - virtkubecri

   A CRI implementation for kubelet that can read the
   config from container image and directly talk to
   libvirtd to launch the VM.

   This allows for libvirt native integration without
   having Docker in the mix. This reduces complexity
   of the stack, and gives stronger guarantees about
   VM shutdown when a container is stopped.

 - virtkubenodeinfo

   A process that runs on each compute node that talks
   to libvirtd to get info about libvirt's view of the
   host. It reports this data upto the Kube API server
   via a custom "VirtNode" resource type, as well as
   "VirtDomain" for each running VM.

 - virtkubeapi

   A process that runs in the cluster solely to register
   the custom resource types with Kube API.
   
     - VirtNode provides info about the virt node.
     - VirtTemplate provides template of a VM config.
     - VirtDomain provides info about a running VM

 - virtkubesched

   A kubernetes schedular extender. This consumes info
   from the VirtNode resource type and the VirtTemplate
   associated with the container and uses that to
   refine Kube's view of which host to run the VM on.


 - virtkubeimage

   Implements the Docker image registry protocol to
   serve docker images containing the virtkubeletshim
   and the VirtTemplate serialized configuration.


Control flows
=============

Cluster setup flow
------------------

For a Docker based cluster:

 - Deploy a "virthost" POD that provides libvirtd,
   virtkubeletinfo and QEMU, to kube nodes

For a Docker-less cluster:

 - Provision Kubernetes using the virtkubetletcri
   daemon, libvirtd, virtkubeletinfo and QEMU to
   bare metal hosts


 - XXX how to deploy scheduler ?

VM create flow
--------------

 - User defines a template for a class of VMs. This
   primarily focuses on defining the guest machine ABI,
   little-to-no backend info.

 - Create one or more PODs / containers that reference
   the VM template(s), providing the backend specific
   metadata to customize the template into a specific
   instance
